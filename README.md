# Snake Game in Python

This Python script implements the classic Snake game, a simple yet addictive arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows in length as it consumes food.

## Features:

- Simple Controls: The game features straightforward controls, allowing players to navigate the snake using arrow keys or other designated keys.

- Scoring System: Players earn points for each piece of food consumed, with the snake's length increasing accordingly. The goal is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the snake's own body or the game borders.

- Speed Adjustment: The game's speed gradually increases as the snake grows longer, providing an additional challenge for players.

- Game Over Detection: The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the game borders, with the player having the option to restart and try again.

## Usage:

1. Run the script to start the Snake game.

2. Use the arrow keys or designated keys to control the snake's movement.

3. Guide the snake to consume food and avoid collisions with its own body or the game borders.

4. Aim to achieve the highest score possible and challenge yourself to beat your previous records.

## Dependencies:
